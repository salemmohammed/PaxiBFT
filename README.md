PaxiBFT

PaxiBFT is a framework designed in Go for implementing, benchmarking, and evaluating Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols under standardized conditions. Its modular architecture empowers developers to seamlessly customize and assess their own protocols. Within PaxiBFT, we have implemented and rigorously evaluated prominent BFT protocols such as Paxos, PBFT, Tendermint, Streamlet, and HotStuff.
