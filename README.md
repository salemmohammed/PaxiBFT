PaxiBFT? 

The purpose of the PaxiBFT framework is to implement, benchmark, and evaluate BFT protocols performance under identical conditions. PaxiBFT is written in Go and built in modules that makes it easy for developers to modify and evaluate their own protocols. On PaxiBFT, we built and evaluated Paxos, PBFT, Tendermint, Streamlet,and HotStuff.
